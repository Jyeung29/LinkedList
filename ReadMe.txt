The included txt files are all used in the driver file (LLDriver.cpp) to perform BuildList(). The included txt files are for creating LinkedLists of type int, Child, char, and string. Int specifically has multiple files for further tests. Each txt files are out of order and some have duplicate values or values that stress the importance of the comparison operators (ie. same lastname and age for a Child). There is also an empty txt file to test for edge case for BuildList().
